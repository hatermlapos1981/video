| Factor                  | Description                                                                 |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Type of Faucet**       | Moen faucets come in various models, and some require specific replacement parts. |  
| **Severity of the Leak**  | Minor leaks may only need a simple O-ring replacement, while major leaks could require a full faucet rebuild. |  
| **Labor**                | The time it takes to diagnose and fix the issue affects the overall cost. |  
| **Parts Needed**          | Depending on the issue, you may need new O-rings, cartridges, or gaskets. |  

## Step-by-Step Process to Fix the Leak  

1. **Turn Off the Water Supply**  
   Locate the shut-off valves under your sink and turn them clockwise to stop the water flow.  

2. **Remove the Faucet Handle**  
   Use a screwdriver or Allen wrench to remove the handle and access the internal components.  

3. **Inspect the O-Rings and Cartridge**  
   Check for worn-out O-rings or a damaged cartridge, which are common culprits for base leaks.  

4. **Replace Faulty Parts**  
   If the O-rings or cartridge are damaged, replace them with Moen-specific parts to ensure compatibility.  

5. **Reassemble the Faucet**  
   Put the faucet back together, ensuring all components are securely tightened.  

6. **Test the Faucet**  
   Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks. If the issue persists, it may require professional attention.
