## Why Does the Faucet Still Leak After Cartridge Replacement?

Replacing the cartridge is often the go-to solution for a leaky faucet, but leaks can persist for several reasons:

- **Improper Installation:** The cartridge may not have been seated correctly or tightened sufficiently.
- **Worn O-Rings or Seals:** Even with a new cartridge, old O-rings or seals can cause leaks.
- **Debris in the Valve:** Mineral deposits or debris can prevent the cartridge from sealing properly.
- **Damaged Faucet Body:** Over time, the faucet body itself can wear out, leading to leaks despite a new cartridge.

Hiring a professional plumber ensures the job is done right the first time. Hereâ€™s what you gain:

- **Expert Diagnosis:** Professionals identify the root cause of the leak, whether itâ€™s the cartridge, seals, or faucet body.
