## Steps in Kohler Faucet Valve Repair  

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the repair process I follow as a professional plumber:  

1. **Inspection**: Assess the faucet to identify the root cause of the issue, such as leaks or reduced water pressure.  
2. **Shut Off Water Supply**: Turn off the water to prevent flooding during the repair.  
3. **Disassemble the Faucet**: Carefully remove the handle and other components to access the valve.  
4. **Replace or Repair the Valve**: Depending on the problem, I either replace the valve entirely or repair specific parts like washers or O-rings.  
5. **Reassemble and Test**: Put the faucet back together and test it to ensure itâ€™s functioning properly.  
6. **Clean Up**: Leave the workspace spotless, as I believe a professional job isnâ€™t complete without a tidy finish.
