## Why Fixing a Leaking Moen Faucet is Essential  
A leaking faucet is more than just an annoyanceâ€”it can lead to costly repairs if ignored. Hereâ€™s why addressing the issue promptly is a smart move:  
- **Prevents Water Damage**: A persistent leak can damage your countertop, cabinetry, and even the floor underneath.  
- **Saves Money**: Fixing a small leak now avoids higher repair costs later and reduces water waste.  
- **Preserves Faucet Longevity**: Moen faucets are built to last, but leaks can shorten their lifespan.  

## What Causes a Moen Faucet to Leak from the Base?  
Understanding the root cause helps in finding the right solution. Common reasons include:  
1. **Loose Parts**: Over time, the nuts and bolts securing the faucet may loosen.  
2. **Worn-Out O-Rings**: The rubber seals inside the faucet can degrade, causing leaks.  
3. **Cracked Components**: Age or wear can lead to cracks in the faucet body or spout.  
4. **Improper Installation**: If the faucet wasnâ€™t installed correctly, leaks can occur at the base.
